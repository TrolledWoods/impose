// ROADMAP TO POINTERS:
//
// - Make pointers work in a scope, but not interact with constants in any way.
// - Allow acquiring pointers from a constant value, by adding some extra instructions.
// - Pointer buffers, with info about how much a pointer contains
// - Assigning pointers/pointer buffers to constants, by creating other constants that contain
//   a copy of the thing that was behind the pointer.
