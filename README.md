# Impose
A silly little compiler for a programming language.

Except it's not a compiler right now, it's just an interpreter. Compilation will come in the future
though! (with full compile time execution using the interpreter)

## Running
For now, this compiler only runs the ``test.im`` file. There is no command line argument
handling yet.

So just call ``cargo run`` and it will run the code in the ``test.im``.

## Hello world
Because every language needs a hello world.
```rust
print("Hello, World!\n");
```

## Examples
For now, check out the ``test.im`` file for a tiny amount of example usage.
``test/complex.im`` also contains some things you may or may not find interesting.
