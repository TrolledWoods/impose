# Impose
A silly little compiler for a programming language.

Except it's not a compiler right now, it's just an interpreter. Compilation will come in the future
though! (with full compile time execution using the interpreter)

## Running
If no command line arguments are given, it will test the folder named 'tests' where the command
is called. This is not final behaviour, it is only there for testing against regressions
when working on the compiler.

If you want to compile a specific program, just type ``cargo run file_name.im`` and it will run
``file_name.im``.

## Hello world
Because every language needs a hello world.
```rust
print("Hello, World!\n");
```

## Examples
Check out the ``tests/`` directory for lots of tests which will show you how features work.

## Syntax
```
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feelingGotta make you understandNever gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbyeNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but
You're too shy to say it

Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert youNever gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert youNever gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)(Ooh)
Never gonna give, never gonna give(Give you up)
We've know each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but
You're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going onWe know the game and we're gonna play it
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you upNever gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
